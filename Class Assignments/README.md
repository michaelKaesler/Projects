This is a collection of past class assignments from undergrad and grad school. Since new students may end up finding this I don't want to put up the prompts for the assignments, and am mostly just going to upload raw code. 

The intended purpose is just to display more programming expertise since the projects I am allowed to upload don't necessairly show the greatest depth of knowledge. 

These are also only a select few of the assignments, and is by no means comprehensive.
