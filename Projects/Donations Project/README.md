The goal was to predict 1995 donations (targdol variable) based off of past donation history and a few other metrics. A logistic model was made to predict the probability an individual would donate, and then a regression model was made to predict, of those that did donate, how much. The expected value for every individual was calculated, and the top 1000 were chosen. These individuals would be marked for a special marketing campaign.
