Due to the competition regulations, the data (images) are not allowed to be uploaded. However, they would be in a seperate directory, with each specific fish type in its own folder within that directory. This is the given format for the Kaggle competition. 

As of this lastest commit, the .py file reads the images, and classifies each species with a CNN using keras with a theano backend.
